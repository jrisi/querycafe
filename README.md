# Query Café

## Mission

You are presented with a user interface for the Query Café. It is
riddled with bugs. Bugs in cafés are never a good idea.

Your mission is to find these bugs (as a team!) and fix the bugs. You
will need to fork this repository, clone it onto your local machine,
patch the bugs, commit, push, and submit a pull request to the main
querycafe repo on SOSS's GitHub page. 

## Ideas

* Split into teams?
* Find a bug and report it! (on GitHub)
* Be sure to leave comments on the issues
* Solve the issues!
